# Sorting Algorithms & Big O Notation

## Overview

This project is part of our Algorithm course and is a collaborative effort between Janet Oluoch and Sospeter Nyabuto. The main goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of sorting algorithms and the concept of Big O notation. We will implement various sorting algorithms in C, evaluate their time complexity, and select the most suitable algorithm for different input scenarios.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement at least four different sorting algorithms in C.
- Gain proficiency in evaluating the time complexity of algorithms using Big O notation.
- Select the best sorting algorithm based on input size and characteristics.
- Follow C programming guidelines, including header files and function prototypes.
